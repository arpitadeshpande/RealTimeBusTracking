# AnimatedMap  
This is code that I wrote with the help of MIT | xPro that is used to show an animaion of bus stops from MIT to Harvard.  
## Moving from One stop to another  
This is a project where we used a mapbox and their features to have a map with custom markers that will go through an animation, and stop on certain bus stops at requested.
